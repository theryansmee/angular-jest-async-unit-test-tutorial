# Testing Asynchronous Code with Jest

## Description

This project contains the unit tests written in my youtube tutorials on.: 
 - [Testing asynchronous code in Angular with Jest: Part 1 - Timers](https://youtu.be/nC_J6mmi3-I)
 - Testing asynchronous code in Angular with Jest: Part 2 - Promises (Coming soon)

_The `master` branch contains the code to be tested and the `with tests` branch contains the completed unit tests_

If you have any questions, leave a comment on the video or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theryansmee).

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test-watch` to execute the unit tests in watch mode via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
